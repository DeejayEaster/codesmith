# codesmith-test

## To-do List
```
Make hamburger prettier and match the mockup.

Give functionality to the tabs and create the state for the hero that will allow switching content for tab selections.

Refine the data services cards and get them to more closely match the mockup

Add carousel functionality and styles to the Partners section in mobile view. 

Add footer twitter and email image assets.

Final component style check to perfect the padding and positioning according to mockup. 

Note: In practice rather than hard coding the cards (like the ones found in the Data Services or Partners section for example) I would use something like JSON Server, which is basically a fake rest api. I would go ahead and create the boilerplate for the api calls, and componitize those cards.
